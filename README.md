## 🌟 Overview

**PhotoEditor** is a full-featured web app that brings professional-grade image editing to your browser.  
Built with pure **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it integrates with advanced client-side libraries for effects, filters, and annotations — and even supports **offline editing** through a **Service Worker**.

It’s designed for creators, photographers, and developers who want a sleek, minimal, and responsive photo editing experience that works everywhere.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🎨 **Powerful Editor:** Crop, draw, resize, blur, filter, and adjust brightness/contrast.  
- ⚡ **Real-Time Rendering:** Edits apply instantly using client-side JavaScript.  
- 📁 **Offline-Ready:** Built with a service worker (`sw.js`) for caching & PWA support.  
- 🧩 **Modular Integration:** Easy integration with the Pixie Editor or other JS libraries.  
- 🧠 **Configurable:** Change defaults via `config.json`.  
- 💾 **Server-Side Safety:** PHP backend (`launderer.php`) for secure uploads or processing.  
- 📱 **Fully Responsive:** Works smoothly on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers.  
- 🧰 **Automated Build:** Managed through **Gulp** with minification and asset bundling.
